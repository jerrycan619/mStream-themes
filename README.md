# mStream-themes
Themes for the great mStream Music server.
Please visit: https://github.com/IrosTheBeggar/mStream/

## How-to Install
**First: I don't know how and if it's works on the Binary and Docker install of mStream!**

For use with the "Install from The Command Line":
you should have a folder structure like this:

<pre>
path/to/mStream/
                |-> build/
                |-> electron/
                |-> modules/
                |-> ... some other...
                |-> public/ --- this is where my themes belong in
</pre>
