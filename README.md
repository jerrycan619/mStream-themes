Themes for the great mStream Music server.

## How-to Install
**First: I don't know how and if it's works on the Binary and Docker install of mStream!**
<br/><br/>
**For use with the "Install from The Command Line" method:**

you should have a folder structure like this:
<pre>
path/to/mStream/
                |-> build/
                |-> electron/
                |-> modules/
                |-> ... some other...
                |-> public/ --- this is where my themes belong in
</pre>

Now download the Theme (or everything) from here und unpack it.
if you've done this you should have a structure like this:

<pre>
path/to/themes/
                |-> dark_green/public
                |-> dark_orange/public
                |-> ...
</pre>

Now pick the theme you want to install and then copy the public folder into the mStream root folder like this:
copy: dark_green/public
paste in: mStream/
and if get asked if you want to overwrite the files choose "yes" (or "overwrite)
