# mStream-themes
Themes for the great mStream Music server.
Please visit: https://github.com/IrosTheBeggar/mStream/

## How-to Install
**First: I don't know how and if it's works on the Binary and Docker install of mStream!**
<br/><br/>
**For use with the "Install from The Command Line" method:**

you should have a folder structure like this:
<pre>
path/to/mStream/
                |-> build/
                |-> electron/
                |-> modules/
                |-> ... some other...
                |-> public/ --- this is where my themes replaces some files
</pre>

Now download the Theme (or everything) from here und unpack it.
if you've done this you should have a structure like this:

<pre>
path/to/themes/
                |-> dark_green/public
                |-> dark_orange/public
                |-> ...
</pre>

Now pick the theme you want to install and then copy the public folder into the mStream root folder like this:<br/>
copy: **dark_green/public**<br/>
paste in: **mStream/**<br/>
and if you get asked if you want to overwrite the files choose "yes" (or "overwrite) to all!<br/>
<br/>
Since there is no dedicated theme engine/api the themed files have to overwrite the default files.</br>
The may break by new updates of mStream but I try to keep them working.<br/>
<br/>
If you find bug's or have suggestion for new Themes please open an "Issue"<br/>
Please DON'T open Issues for problems with the Software itself!!! (do that on the main mStream repository)<br/>
and also DONT'T open Issues for problems with **this Themes** on the main mStream repository!!! (do it HERE)<br/>

Thanks to everyone!
