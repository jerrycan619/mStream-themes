Themes for the great mStream Music server.

# How-to Install
First: I don't know how and if it's works on the Binarie and Docker install of mStream!

For use with the Install from The Command Line:
you should have a folder structure like this:

path/to/mStream/
-> build/
-> electron/
-> modules
-> ... some other...
-> public --- this is where this themes belong in
